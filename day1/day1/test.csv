Toreduce the memory requirement, we present a method for binarizing theparameters of the CP tensor decomposition by introducing a quantizationfunction to the optimization problem. This method replaces floatingpoint-valued parameters with binary ones after training, which drasticallyreduces the model size at run time. We investigate the trade-off between thequality and size of tensor factorization models for several KGC benchmarkdatasets.

Here we propose Knowledge-aware Graph Neural Networks with Label Smoothness regularization (KGNN-LS) to provide better recommendations. Conceptually, our approach computes user-specific item embeddings by first applying a trainable function that identifies important knowledge graph relationships for a given user. This way we transform the knowledge graph into a user-specific weighted graph and then apply a graph neural network to compute personalized item embeddings. To provide better inductive bias, we rely on label smoothness assumption, which posits that adjacent items in the knowledge graph are likely to have similar user relevance labels/scores. Label smoothness provides regularization over the edge weights and we prove that it is equivalent to a label propagation scheme on a graph. We also develop an efficient implementation that shows strong scalability with respect to the knowledge graph size. Experiments on four datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art baselines.

Therefore, the semantics of edges and nodes are critical for representation learning and knowledge discovery in real world biomedical problems.

And they focused only on hard rules, whichalways hold with no exception and usually require extensive manual effort tocreate or validate. In this paper, we propose Rule-Guided Embedding (RUGE), anovel paradigm of KG embedding with iterative guidance from soft rules. RUGEenables an embedding model to learn simultaneously from 1) labeled triples thathave been directly observed in a given KG, 2) unlabeled triples whose labelsare going to be predicted iteratively, and 3) soft rules with variousconfidence levels extracted automatically from the KG. In the learning process,RUGE iteratively queries rules to obtain soft labels for unlabeled triples, andintegrates such newly labeled triples to update the embedding model. Throughthis iterative procedure, knowledge embodied in logic rules may be bettertransferred into the learned embeddings. We evaluate RUGE in link prediction onFreebase and YAGO. Experimental results show that: 1) with rule knowledgeinjected iteratively, RUGE achieves significant and consistent improvementsover state-of-the-art baselines; and 2) despite their uncertainties,automatically extracted soft rules are highly beneficial to KG embedding, eventhose with moderate confidence levels.

Furthermore, the GCN has been evaluated on citation and knowledge graphs, but not extensively on friendship-based social graphs.The drawback associated with the dependencies between layers and the order of node neighbourhood for the GCN can be more prevalent for friendship-based graphs. The evaluation of the full potential of the GCN on friendship-based social network requires openly available datasets in larger quantities. However, most available social network datasets are not complete. Also, the majority of the available social network datasets do not contain both the features and ground truth labels. In this work, firstly, we provide a guideline on simulating dynamic social networks, with ground truth labels and features, both coupled with the topology. Secondly, we introduce an open-source Python-based simulation library. We argue that the topology of the network is driven by a set of latent variables, termed as the social DNA (sDNA). We consider the sDNA as labels for the nodes. Finally, by evaluating on our simulated datasets, we propose four new variants of the GCN, mainly to overcome the limitation of dependency between the order of node-neighbourhood and a particular layer of the model.

,,"    Motivation: Biological data and knowledge bases increasingly rely on SemanticWeb technologies and the use of knowledge graphs for data integration,retrieval and federated queries. In the past years, feature learning methodsthat are applicable to graph-structured data are becoming available, but havenot yet widely been applied and evaluated on structured biological knowledge.Results: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledgegraphs. Our method combines symbolic methods, in particular knowledgerepresentation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neuralnetworks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related informationwithin knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddingscontain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings tothe prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems offunction prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-proteininteractions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance thatmatches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manuallycrafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph,and will thereby open up the increasing amount of Semantic Web based knowledgebases in biology to use in machine learning and data analytics.

,,"    We introduce KBGAN, an adversarial learning framework to improve theperformances of a wide range of existing knowledge graph embedding models. Because knowledge graphs typically only contain positive facts, sampling usefulnegative training examples is a non-trivial task.Replacing the head or tailentity of a fact with a uniformly randomly selected entity is a conventionalmethod for generating negative facts, but the majority of the generatednegative facts can be easily discriminated from positive facts, and willcontribute little towards the training. Inspired by generative adversarialnetworks (GANs), we use one knowledge graph embedding model as a negativesample generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as thediscriminator in GANs. This framework is independent of the concrete form ofgenerator and discriminator, and therefore can utilize a wide variety ofknowledge graph embedding models as its building blocks. In experiments, weadversarially train two translation-based models, TransE and TransD, each withassistance from one of the two probability-based models, DistMult and ComplEx. We evaluate the performances of KBGAN on the link prediction task, using threeknowledge base completion datasets: FB15k-237, WN18 and WN18RR.

Despite the great effort invested in theircreation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata)remain incomplete.We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks(R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Linkprediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples)and entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs arerelated to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and aredeveloped specifically to deal with the highly multi-relational datacharacteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectivenessof R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification.

,,"    Content-based news recommendation systems need to recommend news articles based on the topics and content of articles without using user specific information. Many news articles describe the occurrence of specific events and named entities including people, places or objects.In this paper, we propose a graph traversal algorithm as well as a novel weighting scheme for cold-start content based news recommendation utilizing these named entities. Seeking to create a higher degree of user-specific relevance, our algorithm computes the shortest distance between named entities, across news articles, over a large knowledge graph. Moreover, we have created a new human annotated data set for evaluating content based news recommendation systems. Experimental results show our method is suitable to tackle the hard cold-start problem and it produces stronger Pearson correlation to human similarity scores than other cold-start methods. Our method is also complementary and a combination with the conventional cold-start recommendation methods may yield significant performance gains.

One prominent goal of these approaches is to improve the quality of knowledge graphs by removing errors and adding missing facts.Surprisingly, most embedding techniques have been evaluated on benchmark datasets consisting of dense and reliable subsets of human-curated KGs, which tend to be fairly complete and have few errors. In this paper, we consider the problem of applying embedding techniques to KGs extracted from text, which are often incomplete and contain errors. We compare the sparsity and unreliability of different KGs and perform empirical experiments demonstrating how embedding approaches degrade as sparsity and unreliability increase.",Sparsity and Noise: Where Knowledge Graph Embeddings Fall Short,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D17/D17-1184/,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1184,422,https://github.com/linqs/pujara-emnlp17,1,Machine Translation,,"knowledge graph embeddings,knowledge graphs,question answering"
